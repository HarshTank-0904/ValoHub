Valorant's competitive ranking system consists of multiple ranks and tiers that determine a player's skill level. Here's how it works:

1. Ranks & Tiers
There are 9 rank divisions, each with 3 tiers (except for Radiant):

Iron (I, II, III)

Bronze (I, II, III)

Silver (I, II, III)

Gold (I, II, III)

Platinum (I, II, III)

Diamond (I, II, III)

Ascendant (I, II, III)

Immortal (I, II, III)

Radiant (Top Rank - No Tiers)

2. Matchmaking Rating (MMR) & Rank Rating (RR)
MMR is Riot's hidden ranking system that determines skill level.

RR (Rank Rating) is what players see, ranging from 0-100 points per rank tier.

Gaining 100 RR promotes you to the next tier, while dropping to 0 RR risks a demotion.

3. Placement Matches & Rank Decay
Players must complete 5 placement matches to get their initial rank.

Ranks donâ€™t decay over time but may soft reset at the start of new Acts.

4. How to Rank Up?
Winning matches and performing well individually increases your RR.

Losing games results in RR loss.

Performance matters more in lower ranks but becomes strictly win/loss-based in higher ranks (Ascendant & above).

5. Leaderboards & Radiant Eligibility
Only the top 500 players in a region can achieve Radiant rank.
